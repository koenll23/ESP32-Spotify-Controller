# 🎵 Spotify Controller with TFT Display 🎵

🚀 About This Project:  
This project is a minimalist Spotify controller featuring three physical buttons, a thermistor, and a 1.8-inch SPI TFT display (ST7735, 128x160). The display shows the current track info, and the buttons allow seamless music control.  
  
🎛️ Features  
1.8-inch TFT SPI Display (ST7735 128x160) to display track information.  
Three buttons for:  
Play/Pause ⏯️  
Next Track ⏭️  
Previous Track ⏮️  
Thermistor 🌡️ to measure and display ambient temperature.  
ESP32 Compatible  
  
🔧 Requirements  
Microcontroller: ESP32 / ESP8266 (or another compatible MCU)  
Display: 1.8-inch ST7735 SPI TFT (128x160 resolution)  
Three physical buttons  
Thermistor + resistors  
Jumper wires & breadboard or PCB (perfboard also works :)  
🛠️ Installation  
  
Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/koenll23/ESP32-Spotify-Controller.git    
Install required libraries in Arduino IDE:  
> WiFi.h  
> WiFiClientSecure.h  
> ArduinoJson  
> TJpegDecoder  
> HTTPClient (for API calls to Spotify/IFTTT)  
> SPI.h  
> TFT_eSPI  
> Update WiFi and Spotify info settings in codes.h.  
Compile and upload the code to your ESP32.
   
🎶 How It Works   
The system connects to WiFi on startup.  
The display shows the current track.  
Use the buttons to control music playback.  
The thermistor measures temperature and displays it on the screen.
